# INSTALLATION

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Import InMemoryDB class into your project.
3. Create an instance of InMemoryDB class.

# RUNNING THE CLASS
1. Create an instance of InMemoryDB class.
2. Call begin_transaction() method to start a transaction.
    If a transaction is already in progress, it will raise an exception.

3. Call put() method to insert a key-value pair.
    If the transaction is not in progress, it will raise an exception.
    If the key already exists, the value will be updated.
    If the key does not exist, a new key-value pair will be inserted.

4. Call get() method to get the value of a key.
    If the key does not exist in the transaction data, it will return `None`.

5. Call commit() method to commit the transaction.
    If the transaction is not in progress, it will raise an exception.
    If the transaction is in progress, it will commit the transaction and return the transaction data.
v
6. Call rollback() method to rollback the transaction.
    If the transaction is not in progress, it will raise an exception.
    If the transaction is in progress, it will rollback the transaction and return the transaction data.

### HOW TO MODIFY

To modify the assignment, you should add the implementation of the class to the project.
The user can use the class to perform database functions and manage transactions. Also, they
should make some test cases as well
